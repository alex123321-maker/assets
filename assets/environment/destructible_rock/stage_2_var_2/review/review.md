# Self Review: stage_2_var_2

## Result
- [x] Source matches request and Issue #3 criteria.
- [x] Required review renders generated.
- [x] Silhouette reads from iso/game-like view with distinct angular planes.
- [x] No accidental floating/disconnected geometry.
- [x] Voxel density is intentional and consistent (size=0.15).
- [x] Material count is within budget (3 materials <= 4).
- [x] Triangle count verified (940 tris <= 5000).
- [x] Export validated (model.glb, glTF 2.0, 53640 bytes).

## Metrics
- Occupied voxels: 568
- Triangles: 940
- Visible faces: 470
- Grid: 14x8x14
- World size: 2.10 x 1.20 x 2.10 m

## Visual Self-Review Notes
- **Reference**: `references/rock_concept_reference.png`
- **Observations from Renders (`iso.png`, `front.png`, `side.png`, `top.png`)**:
  - **Silhouette & Massing**: Distinct stylized angular silhouette matching the approved reference row. Polygonal, asymmetric ground footprint with stable ground contact.
  - **Material Fidelity**: Multi-tone natural rock palette (primary stone, sunlit light rock on summit crests, dark crevice shading, and earthy moss in sheltered shelves) provides clear read from isometric camera distance without uniform gray appearance.
- **Reviewer**: Antigravity agent (visual review pass vs approved reference)
